/increment and decrement operators:
/pre increment: if a is a variable it is represented as ++a
 post increment: if a is a variable it is represented as a++
				here a is incremented by one.
				ex a=10;
				printf("%d",a);
				printf("%d",++a);
				printf("%d",a);
			o/p:10 11 11
	in this case the value is incremented first,incremented value is assigned.
pre increment:
				ex a=10;
				printf("%d",a);
				printf("%d",a++);
				printf("%d",a);
			o/p: 10 10 11
