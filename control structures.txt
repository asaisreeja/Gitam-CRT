CONTROL STRUCTURES:
    (iterative statemets)
Types:
1.conditional control structures:
		ex: for,while,and do while loop.
2) Unconditional control structure:
		ex:break and continue.
3)Unconditional uncontrolled structure:
		ex:goto.

For loop:it is used whenever we know exact number of iterations
	for(intilization;condition:increment/decrement)
	statement;
	                                          --or--
	for(intialization;condition;increment/decrement)
	{
	  statement1;
	  statement2;
	  ----------------
	  statement n;
	}

While loop:it is used  whenever we don't know exact number of iterations.
	while(condition)
	{
	      //statements
	}
	entry level checker:

Do while: It is used for represent "menu driven type".
	do
	{
	  set of statements;
	}while(condition);
	exit  level checker.
by default first cycle is executed without verifying its condition. 
It is used for the purpose of "data structure".
